# **Infinite Trading Protocol API Gateway**

The **Infinite Trading Protocol API Gateway** is a robust intermediary layer that secures and filters communication between the internet and the Infinite Trading Protocol API. It ensures the safety, scalability, and reliability of API operations by mitigating risks such as DDoS attacks and other vulnerabilities.

---

## **Architecture**

The API Gateway operates as the central filter in the following architecture:

```
Internet → NGINX → API Gateway → Infinite Trading Protocol API
```

### Key Features:
- **DDoS Protection**: Mitigates Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
- **Endpoint Security**: Protects exposed endpoints from known vulnerabilities.
- **Traffic Management**: Filters and regulates incoming requests.

---

## **Dependencies**

Ensure the following R packages are installed to run the API Gateway:

- **[RSQLite](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RSQLite)**: For SQLite database interactions.
- **[DBI](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DBI)**: Database interface abstraction.
- **[Shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Shiny)**: Web application framework.
- **[Plumber](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Plumber)**: API development framework.
- **[DotEnv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DotEnv)**: Manage environment variables securely.

Install these packages using:
```R
install.packages(c("RSQLite", "DBI", "Shiny", "Plumber", "DotEnv"))
```
